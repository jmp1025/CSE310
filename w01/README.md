# Overview

Teaching helps deepen one's understanding of the subject they're learning.   Now that I've learned a little bit about Python I will share a short video of myself teaching 
how to write a simple "Hello World" program.

Python is an easy and fun language to learn.   Hear is a simple program that prints the words,  "Hello World",  to the console.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment
